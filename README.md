# Clothing Image Classification with Fashion-MNIST

This project aims to classify clothing images using a specialized dataset and deep neural networks.

## Project Description

i`m going to work with an e-commerce company that deals with clothing and wants to classify images of these clothes. I will use a dataset called Fashion-MNIST, organized with images of various types of clothing, created by the research group Zalando Research.

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow**: Google's library specialized in deep neural networks, used as the low-level layer for communication with the machine.
- **Keras**: High-level API built on top of TensorFlow for building and training models.
- **Python**: Programming language used to write the code.

## Project Steps

1. Importing necessary libraries.
2. Loading the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
3. Exploring and displaying the data.
4. Creating graphs.
5. Normalizing the images.
6. Creating, compiling, training, and saving the model.
7. Visualizing model accuracy and loss.
8. Adjusting, testing, and evaluating the model.
